	abstract = {One of the major concerns of ecological and evolutionary research is the prediction of community function in relation to the degree of biodiversity. To clarify the relationship between biodiversity and the expression of plant defence traits, we investigated ant–plant defensive mutualism in the pioneer plant Mallotus japonicus at several sites across Japan. The plant bears ant-attracting extrafloral nectar (EFN) and food bodies (FBs) as indirect defence traits. To reveal variations in ant–plant interactions in the field, we measured species richness of nectar-feeding ants and interaction strength between each ant species and the plant (visiting frequency of each ant species to the plant). We also investigated the expression of EFNs and FBs in natural plant populations at the study sites. To assess the defensive quality of each ant species, we then experimentally estimated the aggressiveness of the dominant ant species. To examine the link between ant species richness and the defensive function of ants, we conducted an ant-exclusion experiment and a common garden experiment to clarify whether the defence efficacy of ants varied in relation to ant species richness. Ant species richness differed among the study sites. We found negative relationships between ant species richness and the mean interaction strength of ant species, the interaction strength of aggressive ant species and the number of EFNs per leaf. The effectiveness of indirect defence by ants was poor at sites where ant species richness was high. When cultivated in the same environment, plants from sites with low ant species richness developed a larger number of EFNs per leaf than those from sites with high ant species richness. Our results suggest that facultative ant–plant defensive mutualism is weakened at sites where ant species richness is high, resulting in a decrease in the number of EFNs per leaf. Such a link between species richness and an indirect trait function may help us to understand the evolutionary patterns of various species traits in complex biological communities.

In order to overcome these challenges a robotic sampler, a 2nd generation Environmental Sample Processor (ESP), was tested for autonomous analysis of eDNA from four commercial fish species in a 4.5 million liter mesocosm. The ESP enabled in situ analysis, consisting of water collection, filtration, DNA extraction and qPCR analysis, which allowed for real-time remote reporting and archival sample collection, consisting of water collection, filtration and chemical preservation followed by post-deployment laboratory analysis. The results demonstrate that the 2G ESP was able to consistently detect and quantify target molecules from the most abundant species (Atlantic mackerel) both in real-time and from the archived samples. In contrast, detection of low abundant species was challenged by both biological and technical aspects coupled to the ecology of eDNA and the 2G ESP instrumentation. Comparison of the in situ analysis and archival samples demonstrated variance, which potentially was linked to diel migration patterns of the Atlantic mackerel. The study demonstrates strong potential for remote autonomous in situ monitoring which open new possibilities for the field of eDNA and marine monitoring.},

Despite this promise, scaling sample acquisition to the size and temporal scales needed for effective monitoring would require prohibitively large investments in time and human resources. To improve upon these problems, here we test the efficacy of an autonomous eDNA sampling system and compare results obtained to traditional eDNA sampling methods. The autonomous sampling instrument consisted of the Environmental Sample Processor, (ESP) coupled to an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). We tested equivalency between the ESP and traditional eDNA sampling methods by comparing the quantification of eDNA across a broad range of taxa, from microbes (SAR11), phytoplankton (Pseudo-nitzschia spp.), invertebrates (krill: Euphausia pacifica) to vertebrates (anchovy: Engraulis mordax). No significant differences in eDNA densities were observed between the sample collection and filtration methods. eDNA filters collected by the ESP were preserved and stable for 21 days, the typical deployment length of the instrumentation. Finally, we demonstrated the unique capabilities of an autonomous, mobile ESP during a deployment near Monterey Bay, CA, by remotely and repeatedly sampling a water mass over 12 hours. The development of a mobile ESP reveals the promise of utilizing eDNA measurements to observe complex biological processes.},

	abstract = {Reconstructing interactions from observational data is a critical need for investigating natural biological networks, wherein network dimensionality (i.e. number of interacting components) is usually high and interactions are time-varying. These pose a challenge to existing methods that can quantify only small interaction networks or assume static interactions under steady state. Here, we proposed a novel approach to reconstruct high-dimensional, time-varying interaction networks using empirical time series. This method, named "multiview distance regularized S-map", generalized the state space reconstruction to accommodate high dimensionality and overcome difficulties in quantifying massive interactions with limited data. When we evaluated this method using the time series generated from a large theoretical model involving hundreds of interacting species, estimated interaction strengths were in good agreement with theoretical expectations. As a result, reconstructed networks preserved important topological properties, such as centrality, strength distribution and derived stability measures. Moreover, our method effectively forecasted the dynamic behavior of network nodes. Applying this method to a natural bacterial community helped identify keystone species from the interaction network and revealed the mechanisms governing the dynamical stability of bacterial community. Our method overcame the challenge of high dimensionality and disentangled complex time-varying interactions in large natural dynamical systems.},

	abstract = {Microbial communities play an important role in driving the dynamics of aquatic ecosystems. As difficulties in DNA sequencing faced by microbial ecologists are continuously being reduced, sample collection methods and DNA extraction protocols are becoming more critical to the outcome of any sequencing study. In the present study, I added a manual, intra-cartridge, bead-beating step in the protocol using a DNeasy® Blood \& Tissue kit for DNA extraction from a filter cartridge without breaking the cartridge unit (“Beads” method) and compared its performance with those of two other protocols (“NoBeads” method, which was similar to the Beads method but without the bead-beating step and “PowerSoil” method, which followed the manual of the DNeasy® PowerSoil kit after breaking apart the filter cartridge). Water samples were collected from lake, river, pond and coastal ecosystems in Japan and DNA was extracted using the three protocols. Then, the V4 region of prokaryotic 16S rRNA genes was amplified. In the library preparation process, internal standard DNAs were included to estimate the number of DNA copies. The DNA library was sequenced using Illumina MiSeq and sequences were analysed using the amplicon sequence variant (ASV) approach. I found that, (a) the total prokaryotic DNA yields were highest with the Beads method, (b) the number of ASVs (a proxy for species richness) was also highest with the Beads method, (c) overall community compositions were significantly different among the three methods and (d) the number of method-specific ASVs was highest with the Beads method. These results were generally robust across samples from all aquatic ecosystems examined. In conclusion, the inclusion of a bead-beating step performed inside the filter cartridge increased the DNA yield as well as the number of prokaryotic ASVs detected compared with the other two methods. Performing the bead-beating step inside the filter cartridge causes no dramatic increase in either handling time or processing cost and it can reduce the potential contamination risk from the ambient air and/or other samples. Therefore, this method has the potential to become one of the major choices when one aims to extract aquatic microbial DNAs.},

Amplicon pyrosequencing can now be applied to longer variable regions of the SSU rRNA gene including the V9 region in eukaryotes. Methodology/Principal Findings We present a protocol for the amplicon pyrosequencing of V9 regions for eukaryotic environmental samples for biodiversity inventories and species richness estimation. The International Census of Marine Microbes (ICoMM) and the Microbial Inventory Research Across Diverse Aquatic Long Term Ecological Research Sites (MIRADA-LTERs) projects are already employing this protocol for tag sequencing of eukaryotic samples in a wide diversity of both marine and freshwater environments.

We show theoretically that the multiple interaction types might hold the key to understanding community dynamics. A moderate mixture of antagonistic and mutualistic interactions can stabilize population dynamics. Furthermore, increasing complexity leads to increased stability in a "hybrid" community.

We hypothesized that fish release DNA into the water at a rate commensurate with their biomass. Thus, the concentration of eDNA of a target species may be used to estimate the species biomass. We developed an eDNA method to estimate the biomass of common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) using laboratory and field experiments. In the aquarium, the concentration of eDNA changed initially, but reached an equilibrium after 6 days. Temperature had no effect on eDNA concentrations in aquaria. The concentration of eDNA was positively correlated with carp biomass in both aquaria and experimental ponds. We used this method to estimate the biomass and distribution of carp in a natural freshwater lagoon. We demonstrated that the distribution of carp eDNA concentration was explained by water temperature. Our results suggest that biomass data estimated from eDNA concentration reflects the potential distribution of common carp in the natural environment. Measuring eDNA concentration offers a non-invasive, simple, and rapid method for estimating biomass. This method could inform management plans for the conservation of ecosystems.},

The decreasing cost and increasing speed of DNA sequencing technology has recently provided scientists with affordable and timely access to the genes and genomes of microbiomes that inhabit our planet and even our own bodies. In these investigations many microbiome samples are sequenced at the same time on the same DNA sequencing machine, but often result in total numbers of sequences per sample that are vastly different. The common procedure for addressing this difference in sequencing effort across samples – different library sizes – is to either (1) base analyses on the proportional abundance of each species in a library, or (2) rarefy, throw away sequences from the larger libraries so that all have the same, smallest size. We show that both of these normalization methods can work when comparing obviously-different whole microbiomes, but that neither method works well when comparing the relative proportions of each bacterial species across microbiome samples. We show that alternative methods based on a statistical mixture model perform much better and can be easily adapted from a separate biological sub-discipline, called RNA-Seq analysis.},

Identifying species from these samples relies on the ability to match sequences with reference barcodes for taxonomic identification. Unfortunately, most studies of environmental samples have targeted ribosomal markers, despite the fact that the mitochondrial Cytochrome c Oxidase subunit I gene (COI) is by far the most widely available sequence region in public reference libraries. This is largely because the available versatile (“universal”) COI primers target the 658 barcoding region, whose size is considered too large for many NGS applications. Moreover, traditional barcoding primers are known to be poorly conserved across some taxonomic groups.},

To comprehensively understand the diversity and ecology of this huge kingdom, DNA barcoding targeting the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the nuclear ribosomal repeat has been regarded as a prerequisite procedure. By extensively surveying ITS sequences in public databases, we designed new ITS primers with improved coverage across diverse taxonomic groups of fungi compared to existing primers. An in silico analysis based on public sequence databases indicated that the newly designed primers matched 99\% of ascomycete and basidiomycete ITS taxa (species, subspecies or varieties), causing little taxonomic bias toward either fungal group. Two of the newly designed primers could inhibit the amplification of plant sequences and would enable the selective investigation of fungal communities in mycorrhizal associations, soil, and other types of environmental samples. Optimal PCR conditions for the primers were explored in an in vitro investigation. The new primers developed in this study will provide a basis for ecological studies on the diversity and community structures of fungi in the era of massive DNA sequencing.},

Here, we used barcoded pyrosequencing to comprehensively survey archaeal and bacterial communities in 146 soils, representing a multitude of soil and ecosystem types from across the globe. Relative archaeal abundance, the percentage of all 16S rRNA gene sequences recovered that were archaeal, averaged 2\% across all soils and ranged from 0\% to 10\% in individual soils. Soil C:N ratio was the only factor consistently correlated with archaeal relative abundances, being higher in soils with lower C:N ratios. Soil archaea communities were dominated by just two phylotypes from a constrained clade within the Crenarchaeota, which together accounted for 70\% of all archaeal sequences obtained in the survey. As one of these phylotypes was closely related to a previously identified putative ammonia oxidizer, we sampled from two long-term nitrogen (N) addition experiments to determine if this taxon responds to experimental manipulations of N availability. Contrary to expectations, the abundance of this dominant taxon, as well as archaea overall, tended to decline with increasing N. This trend was coupled with a concurrent increase in known N-oxidizing bacteria, suggesting competitive interactions between these groups. ¬© 2011 International Society for Microbial Ecology All rights reserved.},

Previous studies have proposed the presence of hypolimnion-specific bacterioplankton lineages that are distinct from those inhabiting the epilimnion. To date, however, no consensus exists regarding their ubiquity and abundance, which is necessary to evaluate their ecological importance. The present study investigated the bacterioplankton community in the oxygenated hypolimnia of 10 deep freshwater lakes. Despite the broad geochemical characteristics of the lakes, 16S rRNA gene sequencing demonstrated that the communities in the oxygenated hypolimnia were distinct from those in the epilimnia and identified several predominant lineages inhabiting multiple lakes. Catalyzed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed that abundant hypolimnion-specific lineages, CL500-11 (Chloroflexi), CL500-3, CL500-37, CL500-15 (Planctomycetes) and Marine Group I (Thaumarchaeota), together accounted for 1.5–32.9\% of all bacterioplankton in the hypolimnion of the lakes. Furthermore, an analysis of single-nucleotide variation in the partial 16S rRNA gene sequence (oligotyping) suggested the presence of different sub-populations between lakes and water layers among the lineages occurring in the entire water layer (for example, acI-B1 and acI-A7). Collectively, these results provide the first comprehensive overview of the bacterioplankton community in the oxygenated hypolimnion of deep freshwater lakes.},

	abstract = {Microbial communities play an important role in driving the dynamics of aquatic ecosystems. As difficulties in DNA sequencing faced by microbial ecologists are continuously being reduced, sample collection methods and DNA extraction protocols are becoming more critical to the outcome of any sequencing study. In the present study, I added a manual, intra-cartridge, bead-beating step in the protocol using a DNeasy® Blood \& Tissue kit for DNA extraction from a filter cartridge without breaking the cartridge unit (“Beads” method) and compared its performance with those of two other protocols (“NoBeads” method, which was similar to the Beads method but without the bead-beating step and “PowerSoil” method, which followed the manual of the DNeasy® PowerSoil kit after breaking apart the filter cartridge). Water samples were collected from lake, river, pond and coastal ecosystems in Japan and DNA was extracted using the three protocols. Then, the V4 region of prokaryotic 16S rRNA genes was amplified. In the library preparation process, internal standard DNAs were included to estimate the number of DNA copies. The DNA library was sequenced using Illumina MiSeq and sequences were analysed using the amplicon sequence variant (ASV) approach. I found that, (a) the total prokaryotic DNA yields were highest with the Beads method, (b) the number of ASVs (a proxy for species richness) was also highest with the Beads method, (c) overall community compositions were significantly different among the three methods and (d) the number of method-specific ASVs was highest with the Beads method. These results were generally robust across samples from all aquatic ecosystems examined. In conclusion, the inclusion of a bead-beating step performed inside the filter cartridge increased the DNA yield as well as the number of prokaryotic ASVs detected compared with the other two methods. Performing the bead-beating step inside the filter cartridge causes no dramatic increase in either handling time or processing cost and it can reduce the potential contamination risk from the ambient air and/or other samples. Therefore, this method has the potential to become one of the major choices when one aims to extract aquatic microbial DNAs.},

Accordingly, quantitative monitoring of biodiversity has been performed for many ecosystems, but it is often time- and effort-consuming and costly. Recent studies have shown that environmental DNA (eDNA), which is released to the environment from macro-organisms living in a habitat, contains information about species identity and abundance. Thus, analysing eDNA would be a promising approach for more efficient biodiversity monitoring. In the present study, internal standard DNAs (i.e. known amounts of short DNA fragments from fish species that have never been observed in a sampling area) were added to eDNA samples, which were collected weekly from a coastal marine ecosystem in Maizuru Bay, Japan (from April 2015 to March 2016) and metabarcoding analysis was performed using Illumina MiSeq to simultaneously identify fish species and quantify fish eDNA copy numbers. A correction equation was obtained for each sample using the relationship between the number of sequence reads and the added amount of the standard DNAs and this equation was used to estimate the copy numbers from the sequence reads of non-standard fish eDNA. The calculated copy numbers showed significant positive correlations with those determined by quantitative PCR, suggesting that eDNA metabarcoding with standard DNA enabled useful quantification of eDNA. Furthermore, for samples that show a high level of PCR inhibition, this method might allow more accurate quantification than qPCR because the correction equations generated using internal standard DNAs would include the effect of PCR inhibition. A single run of Illumina MiSeq produced \&gt;70 quantitative fish eDNA time series in this study, showing that this method could contribute to more efficient and quantitative monitoring of biodiversity.},

Successfully reducing nutrient loading from sewage treatment through restoration activities, induces large changes in phytoplankton composition and biomass, particularly replacement of cyanobacterial dominance. In Lake Suwa, a shallow eutrophic lake in central Japan, recovery has occurred due to water quality restoration efforts since the 1970s. The improvement of lake trophic state from hypertrophic to mesotrophic is accompanied by various changes, such as rapid decreases in biomass of phytoplankton, benthic invertebrates and planktivorous pond smelt, and increases in biomass of aquatic vegetation, mainly floating leaved plants. During re-oligotrophication, zooplankton are important because they are major secondary producers in lake ecosystems. In Lake Suwa, the Research and Education Center for Inland Water Environment, Shinshu University has collected bi-weekly zooplankton samples and analyzed species composition since 1996, when the lake was in a hypertrophic state with serious Microcystis blooms. Lake Suwa is one representative lake for re-oligotrophication in a shallow eutrophic system, and our zooplankton dataset can be used to understand the changes in ecosystem structure and function.},

	abstract = {In aquatic ecosystems, tributaries play an important role in maintaining the populations and diversity of aquatic organisms throughout the drainage basin, but because of their small catchments, these ecosystems are often more susceptible to the effect of land-use changes and flow-regime alterations. Here, we examined anthropogenic effects on benthic macroinvertebrate diversity in the tributary lagoons, collectively called “Naiko,” surrounding Lake Biwa. We sampled macroinvertebrates and determined the environmental characteristics of 20 tributary lagoons. We identified the environmental factors determining the diversity of macroinvertebrates and found that turbidity significantly diminished species diversity. We assessed the anthropogenic stressors that contributed to the increase in turbidity and found that human population density and the proportion of paddy fields in the watershed area were positively correlated with turbidity, most likely caused by erosion of terrigenous organic matter from the paddy fields and urban areas. In addition, the presence of sluice gates and the lengths of channels connecting to the main lake were positively correlated with turbidity, suggesting that these factors lowered hydrologic connectivity and retained organic matter. We concluded that changes to the landscape and decreased hydrologic connectivity caused by human activity increased turbidity, which in turn decreased macroinvertebrate diversity. The identification of these factors in tributaries is vital for developing a strategy for habitat restoration to conserve the entire ecosystem of the Lake Biwa basin.},
